# The original idea behind that was to crudely test the built artifact inside
# the container image with the correct architecture before returning to allow
# the build job to succeed. Basically a smoke test to see if it would execute as
# built at all. I don't recall why I/we abandoned that idea in favor of only
# running the x86 artifact in the job container. So, we're not getting any value
# from those lines of the entrypoint scripts right now, and I agree we'd have to
# embellish the option parsing a bit to get that working.
