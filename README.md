# Ziti Tunneler SDK

The Ziti Tunneler SDK provides protocol translation and other common functions
that are useful to Ziti Tunnelers.

## What's a Ziti Tunneler?

Ziti Tunnelers allow pre-existing TCP/IP applications to access or provide
services on a secure Ziti network. A Ziti Tunneler is a Ziti-native application
that communicates with local peers using TCP/IP and proxies the payload to/from
a Ziti service.

Note that embedding the Ziti SDK directly into an application is preferable to
using a Ziti Tunneler, if possible. A Ziti-native application is secured and
encrypted to the farthest edges of the communication path - all the way to the
application's internal buffers. A Ziti Tunneler cannot secure the communication
between itself and the TCP/IP application.

Ziti Tunnelers are intended for situations where going Ziti-native is expensive
or impossible to implement (e.g. a third-party applications or libraries). Ziti
Tunnelers enable standard TCP/IP applications to reap _most_ of the security and
reliability benefits offered by Ziti networks without changing a line of code.

#### How does ziti-edge-tunnel configure nameservers?

`ziti-edge-tunnel run` provides a built-in nameserver that will answer queries
that exactly match authorized OpenZiti services' intercept domain names, and
will respond with a hard-fail `NXDOMAIN` code if the query does not match an
authorized service.

Optionally, you may enable DNS recursion by specifying an upstream nameserver
to answer queries for other domain names that are not services' intercept
domain names: `ziti-edge-tunnel run --dns-upstream 208.67.222.222`.

`ziti-edge-tunnel` uses the `libsystemd` D-Bus RPC client and will try to
configure the OS's resolvers with `systemd-resolved`. If that's not possible
for any reason then `ziti-edge-tunnel run` will fall back to shell commands
like `resolvectl`. If those too do not succeed then `ziti-edge-tunnel run` will
attempt to modify `/etc/resolv.conf` directly to install the built-in
nameserver as the primary resolver.

`process_host_req()` in [`/lib/ziti-tunnel-cbs/ziti_dns.c`](/lib/ziti-tunnel-cbs/ziti_dns.c) looks up the queried
hostname in the internal map. If the entry exists it returns the answer and
sets query status to `NO_ERROR`. If it does not exist in the map, it sends the
query to an upstream DNS server if available, and otherwise sets the query status to
`REFUSE`. This implies to the caller they *should* keep trying to resolve the
domain name with other nameservers.

## What is the Ziti Tunneler SDK?

The Ziti Tunneler SDK provides functionality that is common to Ziti Tunnelers across
supported operating systems:

- Converse with TCP/IP peers
- Map TCP/IP connections to Ziti sessions
- Respond to DNS queries for Ziti service hostnames

A Ziti Tunneler application that uses the Ziti Tunneler SDK only needs to
implement platform-specific functionality, such as creating a virtual network
interface, and providing a user interface.

A set of callback
functions that interact with the specific _ziti-sdk_ that the application
uses (e.g. `ziti-sdk-c`, `ziti-sdk-go`).

The Ziti Tunneler SDK includes an implementation of the required callback
functions for `ziti-sdk-c`. Here's how a minimal tunneler application written
in C could use the Ziti Tunneler SDK:

```c
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    uv_loop_t *nf_loop = uv_default_loop();
    netif_driver tun = tun_open(NULL, 0); /* open a tun device, and */

    if (tun == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "failed to open network interface: %s\n", tun_error);
        return 1;
    }

    tunneler_sdk_options tunneler_opts = {
            .netif_driver = tun,
            .ziti_dial = ziti_sdk_c_dial,
            .ziti_close = ziti_sdk_c_close,
            .ziti_write = ziti_sdk_c_write
    };
    tunneler_context TUNNEL_CTX = NF_tunneler_init(&tunneler_opts, nf_loop);

    nf_options opts = {
            .init_cb = on_nf_init,
            .config = argv[1],
            .service_cb = on_service,
            .ctx = TUNNEL_CTX, /* this is passed to the service_cb */
            .refresh_interval = 10,
            .config_types = cfg_types,
    };

    if (NF_init_opts(&opts, nf_loop, NULL) != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "failed to initialize ziti\n");
        return 1;
    }

    if (uv_run(nf_loop, UV_RUN_DEFAULT) != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "failed to run event loop\n");
        exit(1);
    }

    free(TUNNEL_CTX);
    return 0;
}
```

Once the Ziti Tunneler SDK is initialized with a network device and ziti-sdk
callbacks, a tunneler application only needs to indiciate which service(s)
that should be
